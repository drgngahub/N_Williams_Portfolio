      <p>
        I’m Nate, a student at San Francisco State University studying Visual Communication Design.<br>
        I’m originally from the Bay Area and a U.S. Navy veteran.<br>
        This site is my first attempt at building something from scratch with code, and it represents a big step forward in learning how to express myself as both a designer and a developer.<br>
        I'm still figuring out what kind of creative work I want to focus on, but I’m starting to enjoy the process of experimenting, trying new tools, and getting things wrong before I get them right.<br>
        Web design feels a little intimidating at times, but it’s also satisfying when things finally click.<br>
        My background gives me a different perspective on problem solving, structure, and communication.<br>
        I’m interested in how visual language can shape experience, and I’m curious about where that interest might take me.<br>
        This project is just the beginning, and I’m looking forward to improving over time.
